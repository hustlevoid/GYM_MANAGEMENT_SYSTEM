GYM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Most gyms all around the world still rely on paper registers to record member's information and basic details. This makes the data difficult to store, search, update, or analyze. One practical real-life use of Python is to digitize this entire process and replace manual registers with a simple, interactive system. By using Python’s features such as dictionaries, lists, and tuples, we can store member data in an organized way and make everyday tasks like searching, updating, or tracking information faster and more reliable.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
This project was built to show how everyday gym activities can be managed using a small software system. The goal is to give a real working example of:
1) User authentication
2) Data handling
3) Menu-driven interfaces
4) Modular program design
The system supports different types of users and organizes their actions in a simple and efficient workflow.

FEATURES
Various features have been implemented in the project for automation of data in GYM. Members can perform various actions like creating signup, logging in securely, entering their personal info with option to edit it, view their assigned workout and diet plan and then log out securely from the menu. Trainers also have many actions like logging in their trainer credentials, viewing registered members, search for specific members and assign workout and diet plans to members as well as tracking their attendance

TECHNOLOGIES USED
Python 3, Basic file storage (JSON/CSV/SQLite depending on expansion), Command-line interface, etc

STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT
1) Install Python 3 on your system.
2) Clone or download this repository.
3) Open the project folder in your terminal or command prompt.
4) Run the program
We will then see the main menu with options for Member Login, Trainer Login, Sign Up, etc.

INSTRUCTIONS
We can test the application by trying to sign up as a new member, logging in with the created account, editing profile details, using the trainer login to view/search members, testing invalid inputs, repeatedly navigating the menu to ensure smooth flow, etc. As the system grows, we can also track membership plan, payment modules, etc.
