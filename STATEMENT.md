PROBLEM STATEMENT
Most gyms still rely on handwritten registers to maintain member details, attendance, and trainer records. This method is slow, difficult to update, and prone to errors. A digital system is needed to store and manage gym data in a more organized, searchable, and reliable way. The goal of this project is to build a simple Python-based application that replaces manual registers with a structured, interactive system.

SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT
The project focuses on digitizing basic gym management operations such as member registration, login, profile editing, trainer access, and data retrieval. The system works through a command-line interface and uses Python data structures to store information.
The scope includes:
1) Member and trainer authentication
2) Basic profile management
3) Viewing and searching member records
4) Assigning workout or diet plans (extendable)
5) Future enhancements like attendance tracking, payment management, persistent storage, and database integration can be added without redesigning the system.

TARGET USERS
The primary users of this system are:
1) Gym Members - Individuals who want to register, update their details, and access assigned fitness plans.
2) Trainers - Staff members who need access to member lists, search functions, and plan assignment features.
3) Gym Administration - Managers who may later handle membership plans, payment records, and full system monitoring.

HIGH-LEVEL FEATURES
1) Member Signup & Login - Secure authentication allowing members to create accounts and modify personal details.
2) Trainer Login System - Enables trainers to authenticate and access member-related functions.
3) Member Data Management - View and search member information quickly using structured Python storage.
4) Workout & Diet Plan Assignment - Trainers can assign personalized plans to members.
5) Modular, Menu-driven Interface - Simple command-line menus guide users through all available operations.
